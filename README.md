This is the repository for the first interview test.

In involves creating a class for a circle based on a radius and defining two methods for that class: area and perimeter.

The writing of the code associated with this test took less than 10 minutes. 

Learning how to actually push the code to Github took less than 10 minutes, however this was supplemented with about 2 hours of learning about what Git is and how to use it locally.
